## Create twitter streamer file
    Filters realtime tweets based on a hashtag:
        Continuously streams tweets in real time, no delay is detected
        Writes results to an output file called tweets.txt
    Since I gave myself next week to implement Pagination and Posting operations, I will
    delay these until next week.
    Also, I worked on integrating pylint and mypy into precommit:
        Our team cannot "git commit" anything until the pylint and mypy
        syntax and style checkers detect zero erros across every file.
        This ensures that our files are consistent and maintainable.
    I fixed all week1-3 code that was prior to my code, to conform with the pylint and
    mypy precommit checks. Now, our team is up-to-date regarding this.

## Create dbsetup.py
    Created a setup file for first-time users who download/clone the postr project
    Running this file creates a database to hold scheduling operations, called
    master_schedule.sqlite.
    Job:
        Holds data for arbitrary text/media posts, with an optional field for
        any additional info that social media sites require
    Bio:
        Holds data for social media bios, with the option of using a
        display name instead of one's first and last name
    Person:
        Holds data for an arbitrary person, which can be linked from
        a bio row through a foreign key
    DailyJob:
        Holds data for an arbitrary job (connected through a foreign key).
        This job can have set intervals and frequencies, and will continue to
        operate until its frequency limit for the day is met.
    MonthlyJob:
        Holds data for an arbitrary job (connected through a foreign key).
        This job can have set intervals and frequenceis, and will continue to
        operatre until its frequency limit for the month is met.
    CustomJob:
        Holds data for an arbitrary job(connected through a foreign key).
        Can be executed on a custom date. The purpose of this table is to hold
        jobs that have separate use cases from a daily and monthly job.

    I also made Inserter.py:
        Given a conneciton to master_schedule.py, inserts rows for
        Person, Job, CustomJob, and Bio tables. The rest of the tables will
        be implemented upon further discussion.
