10/12/2018:
- User Experience Engineer Only:  Create the different GUI pages and a navigation system, so that each developer can work relatively independantly on an API.
- This week will create a base format for a social media platform GUI with buttons and icons. These buttons will be hooked up to the abstract class/interface that all API classes will conform to, and won't actually do anything. A beta of the stats tracking page should exist here, which will read data from the database. A GUI wizard (or similar) process for logging into / authenticating an acount should be created, but again, will not do anything.
- Each team member will take hold of one Social Media platform, listed in their individual Gantt chart, and set up authentication + one other feature. Users should be able to authenticate and perform one media action after this is complete. Tests will be created for work done in this stage.

10/5/2018:
- Create, setup and provide interfaces for the database (to be used with scheduler or stat tracking), the json config where auth keys are stored, and project settings. Create class layout for the project, including all relevant interfaces. Kivy should be runnable, although the GUI does not need to show anything useful. This is just for being able to call any backend function from Kivy


9/28/2018:
- Create repository on Github. Create dockerfile for project to get cross-platform compatibility. Setup project python virtual environment, (with activator), requirements.txt. Setup precommit to ensure style. Set up Tox for testing python. Create a Makefile for ease of use. Choose and enable a code coverage library for test coverage. Create gitignore. Create python auto linting setup (pylint, flake8, mypy) for precommit. Create folder structure


9/20/18 and prior:
- This was before the git server was setup.
- Worked on SRS (requirements document), preliminary
  research, and Gantt charts.
